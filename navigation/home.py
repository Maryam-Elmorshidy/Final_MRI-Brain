    col1.markdown("""<strong style='font-weight: 10000'><span style='font-size: 150%'>Alzheimer's disease (AD)</span></strong> is one of the most common types of neurodegenerative disorders in the aging population. The first signs of AD will typically include forgetfulness and will progress by affecting various functions such as language, motor skills, and memory. However, a slight but noticeable and measurable decline in cognitive abilities, including memory and reasoning abilities, can be associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). An individual diagnosed with MCI could be at risk of later developing Alzheimer's, or can be due to age-related memory decline, thus highlighting the importance of early diagnosis of the disease. Still, clinical and neuroimaging studies have demonstrated differences between MCI and normal controls (NC). Patients diagnosed with MCI can be stratified between early MCI (EMCI) and late MCI (LMCI)""",unsafe_allow_html=True)
