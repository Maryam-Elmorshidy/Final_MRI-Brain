#### 1. Prediction Outcome:
When analyzing the results generated by our Alzheimer's disease prediction model, it's essential to understand how the predictions are interpreted. Each MRI scan undergoes thorough evaluation, resulting in a prediction that assigns probabilities to four distinct classes:

- **AD (Alzheimer's Disease)**
- **CN (Cognitively Normal)**
- **EMCI (Early Mild Cognitive Impairment)**
- **LMCI (Late Mild Cognitive Impairment)**

    st.markdown("""

For instance, a prediction may produce a probability distribution such as [0.2, 0.7, 0.1, 0.0]. Here’s what this distribution signifies:

- **0.2:** This probability indicates the likelihood that the MRI scan exhibits characteristics associated with Alzheimer's Disease (AD).
- **0.7:** This high probability suggests that the MRI scan shows features typical of a Cognitively Normal (CN) state.
- **0.1:** This probability reflects a lower likelihood of Early Mild Cognitive Impairment (EMCI) being present in the MRI scan.
- **0.0:** The absence of probability here indicates that the model assigns a negligible likelihood of Late Mild Cognitive Impairment (LMCI).

Each value represents the model's confidence in classifying the MRI scan into one of these categories based on the patterns and features extracted from the imaging data.

Understanding these prediction outputs is crucial for physicians and healthcare providers to make informed decisions regarding patient care and management strategies.

#### 2.Interpreting Probabilities

Understanding the probabilities assigned by our Alzheimer's disease prediction model provides valuable insights into the patient's cognitive health status:

- **Higher Probabilities:**
  When the model assigns higher probabilities to a specific class (e.g., AD, CN, EMCI, LMCI), it indicates a greater likelihood that the MRI scan shows characteristics associated with that stage of Alzheimer's disease. For instance, a high probability for AD suggests significant markers of Alzheimer's disease, prompting further evaluation and potential intervention strategies.

- **Lower Probabilities:**
  Conversely, lower probabilities across all classes indicate that the MRI scan does not prominently exhibit signs of Alzheimer's disease progression. This scenario suggests a healthier cognitive state or less pronounced abnormalities in the imaging data.

These probabilities help clinicians assess the likelihood of Alzheimer's disease stages based on objective data analysis, guiding them in making informed decisions regarding patient care and management.
